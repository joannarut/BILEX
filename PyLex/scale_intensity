##What does this script do?
##Reads in sound files.
##Scales the entire soundfile so that the vowel's intensity will now equal dB_target.

#Specify the directory where the original files are located, where the scaled files should be created, and the target dB value.
form Enter directory and search string
#Be sure not to forget the slash (Windows: backslash, OSX: forward slash) at the end of the directory name.
#Out Directory folder must first be created, otherwise it won't work!
