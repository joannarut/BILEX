# BILEX
The BILEX assesses monolingual and bilingual children's receptive vocabulary. BILEX works by presenting six distinct images to the child, followed by an audio recording a proficient female native speaker of the respective language naming one of the image. The child’s task is to accurately identify and select the corresponding image associated with the spoken word. This approach offers a significant advantage as it eliminates the requirement for the examiner to possess fluency in all languages being assessed by BILEX.
